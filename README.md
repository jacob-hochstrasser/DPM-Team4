Setting up GitHub
-----------------
To contribute to code for this project, you'll need to set up a GitHub account and join this repository. If you have not already done this, see the "Git Presentation" slides in the Tutorials folder in MyCourses. Once you've done this, put your username on slack, so we can add you to the repository.

Cloning the Repository
----------------------
Once you've gotten set up with GitHub, you just have to clone the repository to start working.
1. Open the GitHub desktop app. If you don't have it, download it : https://desktop.github.com/
2. Choose "Clone Repository"
3. Select "jacob-hochstrasser/DPM-Team4" from the list of available repositories
4. Choose a location where you will be editing the project (ie. your eclipse workspace)

Developing Features
-------------------
1. Create a new branch and name it with the following convention: YOURNAME_<Classes being edited> -> for example, if I were to work on a feature for the project, and I edit the Project, Claw, and Odometer classes, my branch would look something like this : Jacob_Claw_Odometer_Project
2. Edit or add code in Eclipse
3. Go back to GitHub Desktop, add a summary and (optionally) a description and push "Commit to <Your Branch Name>" then push this to the remote repository.
4. Click on Branch->Create pull request or press Ctrl(Command)+R.
5. If there are no merge conflicts, and the branch can be merged automatically, go for it. Otherwise, message Jacob or Pengan, and we will resolve them.
6. Once your branch has been successfully merged into the master, your branch can be deleted (both remotely and locally).
7. Checkout the master branch and fetch the origin again to be up to date with the repository.
8. Notify the group in Slack and Messenger that changes have been made.
